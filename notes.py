# Section 1 Flask Introduction Handout
# Whatever company you work at will want you to know a Python development framework. 
# Flask is one of the two most popular Python web frameworks, and it’s far more user-friendly than the other contender Django. 
# Reddit, Netflix, Lyft, Pinterest, and Airbnb all use Flask in their stack.

# If you want to build a web application, you need to use a framework to do that. 
# Web frameworks are a collection of the foundational tools necessary for web development. 
# Flask maps URLs to the code they are requesting, connects to a database, creates and serves up customizable HTML templates, 
# stores state information in a session, provides testing and debugging tools, and much much more. 

# In this subunit, you'll learn how to use the Flask framework. 
# Flask is what is called a microframework, which means that it provides more minimalistic functionality than an enterprise framework.

# Section 2
# python, js, html, cs & all the other langs, are the building blocks to making a web page.
# Flask is a framework that allows you to use these building blocks to make web pages.

# Goals - Web Development with Python
# Describe the purpose and responsibilities of a web framework

    # (venv) $ FLASK_ENV=development flask run
    # * Environment: development
    # * Debug mode: on
    # * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    # * Restarting with stat
    # * Debugger is active!

# What is a Web Server?
# A program that’s running on a machine and waiting for a web request.
# Note: A web server is a technology that can process requests and issue responses via HTTP, a protocol used to distribute 
# information on the world wide web. Though it’s also used to refer to computer systems and even internet “appliances,” we’ll 
# use web server to refer to the software running on a machine that’s waiting to respond to HTTP requests.

# Request
# web browser --GET/--> Web Server (app.py)
# The server then responds with the exact HTML text for that page:

# Response
# Web Browser <--String of HTML <html>..<html> -- Web Server (app.py)
