# Step one to create a web server with Flask is to import it.
from flask import Flask

# next step is to make a variable called app and set it equal to Flask(__name__)
app = Flask(__name__)

# This is telling python to let Flask run in this file.
# In the terminal then type | flask run | then the server will start
# CTRL + C is how to quit the server.
